<h2>s3</h2>
<h3>Milestone: <a href="../plugin-milestones">1</a></h3>

<p>TODO integrate aws<em>config in the future
INFORMATION:
This plugin was created for store the logstash's events into Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
For use it you needs authentications and an s3 bucket.
Be careful to have the permission to write file on S3's bucket and run logstash with super user for establish connection.
S3 plugin allows you to do something complex, let's explain:)
S3 outputs create temporary files into "/opt/logstash/S3</em>temp/". If you want, you can change the path at the start of register method.
This files have a special name, for example:
ls.s3.ip-10-228-27-95.2013-04-18T10.00.tag<em>hello.part0.txt
ls.s3 : indicate logstash plugin s3
"ip-10-228-27-95" : indicate you ip machine, if you have more logstash and writing on the same bucket for example.
"2013-04-18T10.00" : represents the time whenever you specify time</em>file.
"tag<em>hello" : this indicate the event's tag, you can collect events with the same tag.
"part0" : this means if you indicate size</em>file then it will generate more parts if you file.size > size_file.</p>

<pre><code>      When a file is full it will pushed on bucket and will be deleted in temporary directory. 
      If a file is empty is not pushed, but deleted.
</code></pre>

<p>This plugin have a system to restore the previous temporary files if something crash.
INFORMATION ABOUT CLASS:
I tried to comment the class at best i could do.
I think there are much thing to improve, but if you want some points to develop here a list:
TODO Integrate aws_config in the future
TODO Find a method to push them all files when logtstash close the session.
TODO Integrate @field on the path file
TODO Permanent connection or on demand? For now on demand, but isn't a good implementation.</p>

<pre><code> Use a while or a thread to try the connection before break a time_out and signal an error.
</code></pre>

<p>TODO If you have bugs report or helpful advice contact me, but remember that this code is much mine as much as yours,</p>

<pre><code> try to work on it if you want :)
</code></pre>

<p>The programmer's question is:  "Why you fuck you use name ls.s3....  you kidding me, motherfucker?
The answer is simple, s3 not allow special characters like "/" "[,]", very useful in date format,
because if you use them s3 dosen't know no more the key and send you to hell!
For example "/" in s3 means you can specify a subfolder on bucket.
USAGE:
This is an example of logstash config:
output {
   s3{</p>

<pre><code> access_key_id =&gt; "crazy_key"             (required)
 secret_access_key =&gt; "monkey_access_key" (required)
 endpoint_region =&gt; "eu-west-1"           (required)
 bucket =&gt; "boss_please_open_your_bucket" (required)         
 size_file =&gt; 2048                        (optional)
 time_file =&gt; 5                           (optional)
 format =&gt; "plain"                        (optional) 
</code></pre>

<p>   }
}
We analize this:
access<em>key</em>id => "crazy<em>key"
Amazon will give you the key for use their service if you buy it or try it. (not very much open source anyway)
secret</em>access<em>key => "monkey</em>access<em>key"
Amazon will give you the secret</em>access<em>key for use their service if you buy it or try it . (not very much open source anyway).
endpoint</em>region => "eu-west-1"
When you make a contract with Amazon, you should know where the services you use.
bucket => "boss<em>please</em>open<em>your</em>bucket"
Be careful you have the permission to write on bucket and know the name.
size<em>file => 2048
Means the size, in KB, of files who can store on temporary directory before you will be pushed on bucket.
Is useful if you have a little server with poor space on disk and you don't want blow up the server with unnecessary temporary log files.
time</em>file => 5
Means, in minutes, the time  before the files will be pushed on bucket. Is useful if you want to push the files every specific time.
format => "plain"
Means the format of events you want to store in the files
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL ON THE CODE!</p>
