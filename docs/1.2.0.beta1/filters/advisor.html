<h2>advisor</h2>
<h3>Milestone: <a href="../plugin-milestones">1</a></h3>

<p>INFORMATION:
The filter Advisor is designed for capture and confrontation the events.
The events must be grep by a filter first, then it can pull out a copy of it, like clone, whit tags "advisor<em>first",
this copy is the first occurrence of this event verified in time</em>adv.
After time<em>adv Advisor will pull out an event tagged "advisor</em>info" who will tell you the number of same events verified in time_adv.
INFORMATION ABOUT CLASS:
For do this job, i used a thread that will sleep time adv. I assume that events coming on advisor are tagged, then i use an array for storing different events.
If an events is not present on array, then is the first and if the option is activate then  advisor push out a copy of event.
Else if the event is present on array, then is another same event and not the first, let's count it.<br/>
USAGE:
This is an example of logstash config:
filter{
 advisor {</p>

<pre><code>time_adv =&gt; 1                     #(optional)
send_first =&gt; true                #(optional)
</code></pre>

<p> }
}
We analize this:
time<em>adv => 1
Means the time when the events matched and collected are pushed on outputs with tag "advisor</em>info".
send<em>first => true
Means you can push out the first events different who came in advisor like clone copy and tagged with "advisor</em>first"</p>


<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    <a href="#add_field">add_field</a> => ... # hash (optional), default: {}
    <a href="#add_tag">add_tag</a> => ... # array (optional), default: []
    <a href="#remove_field">remove_field</a> => ... # array (optional), default: []
    <a href="#remove_tag">remove_tag</a> => ... # array (optional), default: []
    <a href="#send_first">send_first</a> => ... # boolean (optional), default: true
    <a href="#time_adv">time_adv</a> => ... # number (optional), default: 0
}

}
</code></pre>

<h3> Details </h3>

<h4> 
  <a name="add_field">
    add_field
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#hash">hash</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is {} </li>
</ul>

<p>If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:</p>

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    add_field =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}", "Hello world, from %{source}" ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the event has field "somefield" == "hello" this filter, on success,
would add field "foo_hello" if it is present, with the
value above and the %{source} piece replaced with that value from the
event.</p>

<h4> 
  <a name="add_tag">
    add_tag
    
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is <a href="../configuration#array">array</a> </li>
  <li> Default value is [] </li>
</ul>

<p>If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
syntax. Example:</p>

<pre><code>filter {
  advisor {
    add_tag =&gt; [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the event has field "somefield" == "hello" this filter, on success,
would add a tag "foo_hello"</p>
